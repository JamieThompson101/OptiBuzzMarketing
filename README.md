# OptiBuzzMarketing

Hi! I'm Jamie Thompson-- the creator of this project.

My motivation for this project was to put my HTML and CSS skills to the test.

I built this project to demonstrate basic website interactivity and various designing elements to complement.

Through the creation of this project, I learned how various CSS and HTML elements and classes affect a website's appearance and interactivity. Thus, I have mastered how to use them to make a website really stand out.

This project features starter code that was created by Georgeyoo on GitHub
